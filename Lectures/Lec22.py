# Sets, Dictionaries, and tuples

# tuples are immutable lists

t = (1,3)
# count and index

# just a way to group values (type independent)
c = tuple('abc') # rips apart strings
print(c)
# 2 caviots: s2 and s4
n = tuple([1,2,'a'])
print(c,n)

# (1,) vs (1)
# create tuple w one element

# can unpack
# can modify the contents of lists of a tuple if theyre mutable
# t = (L1, L2), insides of Li can be changed

# + is defined as normal

# slice and index the same, except you can't change outermost items of a tuple

# can't extend or remove elements, otherwise, it is the same as a list
