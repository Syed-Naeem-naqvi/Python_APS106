
# Algorithm
# 1) Create an empty 2D array
# 2) Now, fill in the 2D array with contents of img
# 3) Create ranges for the x and y values, for extracting the segment.
# 4) Create empty segment array for extracted values
# 5) Define some change of coordinate factors, ex), call them fx, fy
# 6) Extract the segment by looping through the 2D array, add to the empty segment array
# 7) Convert the extracted segment into a 1D tuple
